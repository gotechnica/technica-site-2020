# technica-site-2020
Technica's main site for 2020!

*NOTE:* This website project uses SCSS, you will need to `npm install` to get the dependencies necessary to watch for changes in `.scss` files, which get processed into the `.css` this site uses.

Don't try to edit the `.css` files directly :)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Watch SCSS changes

```bash
npm run web
```
